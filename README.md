## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![picture alt](https://github.com/ChristinaGalley/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-/blob/main/Resources/Linear_Regression_to_Predict_MPG.png)

- Vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept are variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the MechaCar dataset.
- The slpoe of the linear model is not zero since the p-value is signifficantly lower than 0.05.
- The linear model is about 70% effective at predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes as indicated by the multiple R-squared value of 0.71. Granted that only vehicle length and ground clearance provide a significant amount of variance, the effectiveness is somewhat limited.
